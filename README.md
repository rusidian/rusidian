## About Me

I am a graduate of Information Convergence at Kwangwoon University with a strong foundation in software development and data analysis.

My experience includes Python programming, algorithm problem solving, and data processing using libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. I have also worked on visualization and dashboard projects to deliver data-driven insights.

During my undergraduate studies, I participated in industry-academic cooperation projects and graduation exhibitions, where I received awards for software project achievements.

I am currently preparing to begin my professional career in Software Engineering or Data-related roles, continuing to strengthen both my technical skills and project portfolio.
